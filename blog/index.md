# 3D Vision and Geometry

## Overview

3D geometry represents the main channel through which humans, or robot agents, understand and interact with each other and with the real world. As such, 3D computing and learning technologies have been developed and applied in emerging applications, such as autonomous systems, augmented reality and digital production.
I am interested in several key topics in the discipline area of geometry and deep learning, such as 3D geometry representation, 3D shape understanding and reasoning, and image-based 3D reconstruction. The target is to understand the process of 3D object creation for 3D generation and 3D relational reasoning, and to find the connection between 2D visual observation and the 3D world for single-image 3Dreconstruction.


## Prerequisites
mathematics, including calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics, and the ability to write computer programs. 

## Shape Generation

## Geometry Feature Learning

## Single View Reconstruction
3D shape reconstruction from a single image has been one of the central problems in computer vision. Empowering the machines with the ability to perceive the imagery and infer the underlying 3D shapes can benefit various downstream tasks, such as autonomous driving, robot navigation, etc. However, the problem is overly ambiguous and ill-posed, and thus remains highly challenging, due tothe information loss and occlusion occurred during the imagery capture.
